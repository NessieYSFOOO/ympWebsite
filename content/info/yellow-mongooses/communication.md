Main Research Questions
Our current research on vocal communication encompasses various topics, including vocal ontogeny, call repertoire formation, alarm calling, and the social influences on vocalisations. Our data collection methods include microphone audio recordings of individuals, audiocollars, and experiments featuring playbacks of previously recorded and manipulated calls. These, combined with continuously recorded behavioural and life history data, facilitate in-depth studies of the communication systems of yellow mongooses across all age categories.
Due to our continuous visits and individual tracking, we have achieved a high level of habituation within our wild yellow mongoose population. This enables us to collect both life history and sound data from a very young age. Pups are recorded as soon as they emerge from their birth burrows, while older individuals, such as juveniles and adults, can be monitored with directional microphones to capture vocalisations typically emitted in social contexts.
In yellow mongooses, both males and females share responsibility for caring for their offspring. They have been observed babysitting and feeding their young. These frequent social interactions among group members are usually accompanied by a range of vocalisations that can be affiliative, neutral, or aggressive, depending on the situation. Furthermore, yellow mongooses emit alarm calls when group members are present and a potential predator is detected. There are further contexts in which yellow mongooses communicate vocally, however, there is currently very little known about this species' communication system. Our research aims to investigate both the proximate and ultimate causes behind the evolution of yellow mongoose vocalisations.

Findings So Far
Observations indicate that yellow mongoose pups can produce over 10 call types within their first three months of life. Interestingly, they appear to replace their individual vocal repertoire as they mature. Upon reaching juvenile status, they cease producing most of their pup-specific calls and begin to emit the call types associated with the species'  adult call repertoire.
Further research into the development of the yellow mongoose communication system and its potential complexity are currently ongoing.
