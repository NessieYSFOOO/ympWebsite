The Kalahari Yellow Mongoose Project
The Yellow Mongoose Project (YMP) commenced in 2022, making it the youngest research project at the Kalahari Research Centre. The primary aim of the project is to deepen our understanding of these fascinating, desert-dwelling mammals, which are classified as facultatively social. This means they live in small family groups, sharing burrow systems at night and in the early morning, but forage primarily solitary during the day. Our ability to closely observe individually marked and recognisable study animals enables us to explore a range of research questions that are often difficult to address in wild animals.

Here is a list of topics of reasearch on yellow mongooses.
